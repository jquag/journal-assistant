Today was great. The weather was perfecto, Caleb scored two goals, and a storm was rolling in after dinner while we sat outside.

We got the pond in order today. Melissa was all up in it. She unleashed some ungodly smells but in the end it looked very good.

Oliver escaped today and had his own adventure. Luckily he decided to come home. I was pulling weeds and just saw him trotting up towards Galena's house. I was like, "What?, is that Oliver. Get over here Oliver".

We had tacos and Margarita's for dinner. The kids just had tacos.

The only bad thing about today was that the kids can't stop fighting. They are always fighting these days. Oh, and that Melissa, Caleb and I missed church because of the soccer game. Lucy went with Nonna and Poppy.
